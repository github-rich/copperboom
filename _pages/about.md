## Let's talk Gilmore Girls.  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Whether you've just discovered the show or you're on your bazillionth re-watch, we understand.  You NEED to talk about it.  With a village who understands.  We've got you.  Welcome to Gilmore Girls Blog.  

> <strong class="inline-strong">Weâ€™re just here to hang out.  Without agenda, without ads. Without having to like or subscribe.  Just love what you love.</strong>

Between 2009 and 2019 I contributed to [GilmoreGirlsNews.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090213070938/http://www.gilmoregirlsnews.com/) and subsequently [GilmoreNews.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20130915100202/http://www.gilmorenews.com/) until they went the way of the dodo...  Those were some cold, dark wilderness years, between the TV show ending and ultimately the Netflix revival.  But the need to talk to someone about it was overwhelming.  About how great it was, how funny, how tearjerking. How smart.  

There weren't many Gilmore Girls fan sites and we attracted a community that patiently tolerated my weekly outpouring of often nonsense.  I believe they even began to appreciate it.  By the time the Netflix shows became a serious consideration, there was plenty of coverage.  We had played our part in getting us there.  But now, to be honest, I just miss talking about it.

Heartbreakingly, I don't have the original comments or community.  Just the posts I wrote and a few more that were never published.  The plan is just to keep them in this little corner of the internet for safe keeping.  To keep the pilot light on.  

It's likely I'll add a fresh thought from time to time.
