Have you ever watched Gilmore Girls in anything other than English?  Or do you use Gilmore Girls to improve your English?

 Sometimes it sounds like they’re talking in a different language anyway, viz. Copperboom, pickleschnitz...

> __Luke__  I was being a... I don’t know, what’s that word you use – pickleschnitz?
>__Lorelai__ Schnickelfritz?
> __Luke__  Yeah, that’s it.

I love their use of language.  It's fantastic writing but that doesn't necessarily translate to other languages.  The global affection for the show suggests that there are translators equally up to the task.

I’ve found versions in Spanish, French, Italian and German... are there more?  I’ve found a reference to a Japanese version, which must be dubbed into something else in that scene where Lorelai is introducing a Japanese group and their translator around the Inn...

Then the next minute they’re improving our global vocabulary, teaching us the plural of cul-de-sac is CULS-de-sac, what a chuppah is, and the proper pronunciation of...

> __Emily__  Can I have my program back, then? As my friend Sylvia Rosenblatt is saying, I’m “shavitzing.”
> __Lorelai__  Schvitzing, Mom. Schvitzing.  Never mind.
> <span class="episode-ref">s07e21 Unto the Breach</span>

So can anyone let me know __how the worldwide translations of Gilmore Girls compare?__  

Are the same cultural references shoehorned in or (more likely) do they try to translate them into something more relevant for the target country / countries?  I’d love to hear an example.

__Have you used Gilmore Girls to improve your English__ and if so, how did that work out for you?

__What’s your favourite Gilmore word__, real or invented?  Mine’s a real one but it always make me smile... Marzipan.
