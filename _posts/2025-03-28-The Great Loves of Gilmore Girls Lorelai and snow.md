She’s staring at the window expectantly, restlessly.  Maybe she’s expecting Max to burst through it.  Maybe it’s because she forgot to take her earrings out. Or close the curtains.  She comes downstairs and plays Max’s answerphone message again.  And again.  Ah, new love. 

She lifts the sash window open, closes her eyes and breathes in the frosty air.  It’s a beautiful moment of pure childlike enjoyment and carefree anticipation.  Lorelai has her hair in bunches and is cute to the point of overwhelming.  ‘How can you be so adorably cherubic?!’ I want to shout, pinching her porcelain cheeks, tears streaming down mine.  You kinda get the feeling Lauren Graham does this kind of thing for real while Peter Krause rolls his eyes, she’s effortless.

> __Lorelai__  Everything’s magical when its snows, everything looks pretty. The clothes are great. Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.
> __Rory__  Thermal underwear, wool socks. Ear flaps.
> __Lorelai__  Do you know the best things in my life have happened when it snowed?
> __Rory__  Why yes, I do.
> __Lorelai__  My best birthday.
> __Rory__  Your first kiss.
> __Lorelai__  Your first steps, they all happened when it snowed. 
> __Rory__  Feet.   
> [Lorelai pulls her feet up onto the sofa and Rory covers them with the throw]
> __Lorelai__  I feel good. Tingly.
> __Lorelai__  That’s called frostbite.

SNOWING!!!

Of course every relationship has its difficulties.  Later on - in season 5 - words are exchanged in anger when the weather causes cancellations at the inn and snows in her Jeep.  It's a one-way exchange.  Lorelai thrashes it out with the snow - but at least she has Luke who later brokers peace between them... with a homemade ice rink to chill out on.

> __Lorelai__  Me and snow, we are through. It was years of bliss y'know, we had good stuff and good times. I could show you pictures of snow angels I've made but I am done! Done!!
> __Luke__  Well, let it down easy OK?
