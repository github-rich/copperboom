Have you ever wondered why Edward Herrmann receives special treatment in the Gilmore Girls opening credits, his name preceded with *‘Special Appearance By’*?

Our favourite envelope-handing father figure is no stranger to the screen, small or silver.  With a long, storied portfolio he is quite the casting catch.

Remember him as moderate vampire in *The Lost Boys* or Richard Rich in *Richie Rich*?  Or before that, displaying his sterling range of faces in TV land, including *St Elsewhere*, *Oz* and *The Practice*.  Not to mention two high billing roles opposite Robert Redford in *The Great Gatsby* and *The Great Waldo Pepper*.  

Did you recognise his reassuring patriarchal tones as the voice of the Stratton Oakmont TV commercial in *The Wolf of Wall Street*?

At 70 years old now, the camera continues to love him and his effortless ability to portray smart or plummy, the fool, the confidante, the fop.  Yes, even the re-animated Frankstein’s Munster in *Here Come The Munsters*.

Since Gilmore Girls ended, you might have seen that big hunk of a man in 30 Rock and Greys Anatomy, as well as marking his territory in Matt Czuchry’s patch (Logan Huntzberger), as Lionel Deerfield in *The Good Wife*. 

He also appeared as a reverend in *How I Met Your Mother* where he suffered his third (fictional) heart attack.
