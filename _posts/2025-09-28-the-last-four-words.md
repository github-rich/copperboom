Part of the Gilmore Girls mythos is that the show’s creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has the last four words rattling around in her head.  Words that she would have written, had the studio kept her for the final series or asked her to write the final episode.

> __Lorelai__  When the negotiations [for the final season] got so crazy we thought, 'Maybe we’re high?' Maybe they don’t want it for the next couple of years. But by not having control of that, it shifts the focus of what my last words would have been. I was also holding on to it for a long time because I was thinking if we did do a movie, I would be able to use it there. I don’t think that’s ever going to happen so, I don’t know. Maybe I’ll eventually say the four words. I feel like now I’ll let people down because it’s been so built up. 'Really? That’s what we waited all these twelve years for? Well, thanks so much.'

Since that quote, we’ve had the Veronica Mars kickstarter and the subsequent outpouring of Gilmore love in response.  We’re also going through this weird Bunheads hiatus and I can’t see ASP twiddling her thumbs waiting for inspiration. Somewhere out there, I’m thinking ideas are knitting together. JK Rowling wrote the final chapter of the seventh Harry Potter book long before the first was even typed up... Gah, it’s such a tease! I can’t help thinking that if you know the destination, you’ve got some idea about the journey.

__What do you think those final four words might be?__  
__And who says them?__  

Get your thinking hats on and browse these last lines of Gilmores past for inspiration:

Series 5:

> __Lorelai__  Luke will you marry me?
> __Luke__  ... What?
> <span class="episode-ref">s05e22 A House Is Not A Home</span>

Series 4:

> __Rory__  I hate you for ruining this for me!
*Rory runs out of the house and calls Dean’s mobile phone. His wife answers.*
> __Lindsay__  Hello? Hello? Hello?
> <span class="episode-ref">s04e22 Raincoats And Recipes</span>

Series 2: Lorelai and Rory at Sookie and Jackson’s wedding.  Both have been knocked askew, Rory from kissing Jess and Lorelai from Christopher’s news that Sherry is pregnant - followed by his departing in a cloud of dust.

> __Rory__  I think I’m going to Washington.
> __Lorelai__  Oh... Okay.
> <span class="episode-ref">s02e22 I Can’t Get Started</span>

Series 3: Rory’s graduated from Chilton and they’re about to leave the school building for the last time.

> __Lorelai__  It’s not so scary any more.
> __Rory__  No. No, it’s not.
> <span class="episode-ref">s03e22 Those Are Strings, Pinocchio</span>

My guess?

> __Lorelai (to Luke)__  It’s never too late.

Or maybe...

> __Kirk__  Help? Help somebody please?
