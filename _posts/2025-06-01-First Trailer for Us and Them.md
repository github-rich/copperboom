Alexis Bledel (who you may recognise as Rory Gilmore from Gilmore Girls) and Jason Ritter (recently seen as Lauren Graham’s romantic interest in Parenthood) have a new trailer for Fox’s new mid-season show, __Us and Them__.

Based on the cult BBC show __Gavin and Stacey__, the trailer looks promising and gives a good glimpse of Alexis with a new ‘do, starring as the sweet Stacey who travels from Pennsylvania to New York for a first in-person date with down-to-earth co-worker Gavin.

The supporting cast of friends and family is gagging with comedic talent and the series has solid roots.  Could be good.  Could be great?  __What do you think?__
