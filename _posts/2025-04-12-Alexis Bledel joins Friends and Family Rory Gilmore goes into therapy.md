There’s a shrink somewhere rubbing his hands with glee. Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls’ Rory Gilmore) joins the pilot cast of *Friends and Family*, the US adaptation of cult Britcom Gavin and Stacey.

Alexis will star as Stacey, a sweet and strong girl who travels from Pennsylvania to New York for a first in-person date with co-worker Gavin. So far, so normal but here’s where it gets weird. Gavin will be played by Jason Ritter, who we last bumped into as Lauren Graham’s (Gilmore Girls’ Lorelai Gilmore and Rory’s MOTHER) romantic interest in Parenthood. Like, blech.

Thank heaven this plotline never played out in the Gilmore universe, although I wouldn’t put it past Kirk to ask Rory out, a few years down the line. Too weird. Reminds me of last time Rory was at shrink after getting out of jail, after stealing a boat with Logan:

> __Rory__ I stole a boat with him! I never stole a boat with Dean!
> __Dr Shapiro__ Who’s Dean?
> __Rory__ My married ex-boyfriend who I lost my virginity to.
> __Dr Shapiro__ Wow...
> __Rory__ Yeah, I’m a treat.

The pilot brings its British production staff and writing talent, so fingers crossed for Alexis and the series – who knows what the American television production process will do to mangle the cult show. Another *The Office* – or another *Red Dwarf*?
