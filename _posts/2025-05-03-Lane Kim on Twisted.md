So whatever happened to Rory’s best bud, Lane Kim?  In the wild and wacky world of cross-show parallel universe TV-land, where Jason Ritter dates Lorelai Gilmore (in Parenthood) then her daughter Rory (in Us & Them), __Lane has become a high school grief counsellor__.

We’re sending some Gilmore-love and bestest wishes to Keiko Agena (Gilmore Girls’ long-suffering, hair-tousling, twin-toting bad-ass-drummer Lane Kim) who will guest spot in the upcoming ABC Family ‘mystery’ show, Twisted.  

The show centres on a charismatic sixteen year guy just out from five years in juvenile detention, re-connecting with his two female best friends from childhood.  Sounds like he had a mum like Mrs Kim.

__Might Lane have actually become a counsellor?__  

I can see her and Zack raising the twins to fill out the band, playing rhythm guitar and keyboard.  They play fusion country rock at family-friendly festivals with their loving, nutty uncles, Brian and Gil.  Freebird!

Man, I just realised that Lane and Zack’s twins, Steve and Kwan, would be six years old now.  But Keiko will always look 17.  We’ll have some of what she’s having, thangyouverymuch.

__What was your favourite Lane Kim moment?__  
__What do you think she’s up to now?__
