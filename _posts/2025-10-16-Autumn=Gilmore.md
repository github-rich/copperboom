Gilmore season again.  Or Autumn, as the rest of the world calls it.  

'Fall', too.  Why just rename that one?  If you're here, you know that it's purely to fit the lyric, 'All you have to do is call.'  

The show remains a go-to for the feeling of a comforting hug and friends.  A refuge from the sea of troubles in the real world.  I continue banging these reposts out on a mostly weekly basis but I'm not exactly sure why any more.

The internet has fast become a mess of content and there doesn't currently seem like there will be a way back.  It was good while it lasted?  Rose-tinted spectacles?  Change is the only constant, so it's said, and this is merely a stepping stone on the way to something else.  Hopefully something good at some point, before that itself is replaced.

How long until it's impossible to tell whether something was written by a person, or a computer?  If you can't tell, does it matter any more?  I mean, I think it does but then I like to write.  Does AI enjoy writing?  I'm sure it'll tell you it does.  It'll gobble up these very words and chew them up and spit them back.

I'm off to run the hospital tea trolley in a minute, a little volunteering gig.  In November I'll be polishing up my second book.  At some point I'll be adding extra pages to the site to show all the articles that have fallen off the first two pages.
