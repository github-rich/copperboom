To prove it can be done, here’s mine.  But first the runners-up (runner-ups?)... the close contenders: 

> Episode One, where they both put on Macy Gray  

> “Hole. HOLE. Hole - dirt... bed, dirt? HOLE.” (I’m paraphrasing here)  

> The town loner protesting - or maybe supporting - noodlescooze  

> Stars Hollow’s fairwell to Rory, where Melissa McCarthy is genuinely barely holding it together

If I had to pick my absolute favourite scene, it’s Lorelai sweeping pizza crusts under the sink. So there, I’ve said it. And I totally reserve the right to change my mind 24 times in the next 5 minutes.

Oh but wait there's:

> Luke persuades Jess into an involuntary swim  

> The 24-hour dance marathon  

> Luke’s timing finally falls into sync as he walks in on Lorelai’s karaoke  

> Cyrus moves a little to the left

Anyone else wonder how bad the takeout from Al’s Pancake World really is?  I'm hankering for a chow mein sandwich right now.
