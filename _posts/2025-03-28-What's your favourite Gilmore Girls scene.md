My chain of thoughts was interrupted today by a colleague asking me what I was thinking about.  I’d been away with the fairies, a dappy smile on my face.  ”Favourite pizza”, I replied - my go-to - but actually I was replaying Gilmore Girls scenes in my head.

__What's your favourite scene from Gilmore Girls?__  It's a difficult - possibly impossible - question to answer.  Favorite in what way?  For all the reasons you’re here reading about a show that ended five years ago.  Something sweet but honest?  Something that gave you a perspective on growing up or parenting?  Some inspired kookiness that just made you laugh when you needed it?  Perhaps all the above.  I like a challenge and I’m not scared of getting shot down.  So here are my close contenders:

> From the pilot, Lorelai and Rory argue, then simultaneously put on Macy Gray’s CD.  It’s amusing and clever and perfectly pitches us the overlap in their temperaments.

> Luke’s horoscope and declaration: He’s all in / “Would you just stand still?”

> Stars Hollow’s fairwell to Rory, where Melissa McCarthy is barely holding it together

> “Hole. HOLE. Hole – dirt… bed, dirt? HOLE.” I’m paraphrasing here.

But in this thirty second window between typing and posting, if I had to pick my absolute favourite scene, it’s Lorelai sweeping pizza crusts under the sink – and getting caught by Rory.  It’s got their role reversal, abuse of the kitchen and it’s just a damn funny thing to do.

__Too hard? How about two favourite scenes from your top ten?__  
__Anyone else wonder how bad the takeout from Al’s Pancake World really is?__  I only ask because I'm hankering for a chow mein sandwich right now.  
__What’s your favourite pre-credits scene?__
