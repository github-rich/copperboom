Gilmore Girls was lightning a bottle, a serendipity that commingled story, slapstick and a sizzling script for characters and actors that first-time viewers are still falling in love with.  

Some of those actor / character relationships are so strong, it makes me wonder: could anyone else have played Michel or Mitchum?  Or Logan or Babette?

Liza Weil (Paris Geller) originally auditioned for the role of Rory, before the role of Paris was custom-made for her.  It’s similarly difficult to envisage anyone but Melissa McCarthy as Sookie St James, even though Alex Borstein was originally cast in that part.  Alex was re-cast first as Drella the moody harpist, then unrecogniseably later as Emily's eccentric dresser, Miss Celine.

Sean Gunn first made his mark as Mick the DSL installer.  He was then re-cast as ‘Swan Man’, before forever becoming Kirk Gleason in episode 5.  Would Stars Hollow still be Stars Hollow without Sean’s Kirk? Would Rory have had the same childhood without Liza’s Paris and Melissa’s Sookie?   Could anyone else have embodied Taylor Doose but Michael Winters?
