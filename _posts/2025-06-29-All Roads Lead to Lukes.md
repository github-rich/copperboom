So I fully intended this entry to ponder the Gilmore Girls spin off that never was: *Windward Circle* AKA Jess’ adventures in Los Angeles.

Gilmore Girls Season 3 episode 21 'Here Comes The Son' was a backdoor pilot episode in which Jess meets some west-coast youngsters who look like Hansen, talk like Shakespeare and half-inch his book – the rascals! One of them is alarmingly reminiscent of Luke’s short-lived waiter Brennon, the froggy sandwich boy:

> __Lorelai__  He doesn’t write the orders down, he never brings you food that’s hot or yours, he can’t distinguish bagels from doughnuts, he hands out butt napkins, and he has worn that Foreigner t-shirt every single day since he started working here and he doesn’t know who they are. I asked him.
> __Luke__  What are butt napkins?
> <span class="episode-ref">s01e19 Emily in Wonderland</span>

But like a word association game, my mind leapt ironically frog-like to Brennon’s replacement: Lane.

> __Rory__  Luke brought her in for an interview and everything.
> __Lorelai__  Interview? So official!
> __Rory__  Yeah they sat in complete silence for a full five minutes, then Luke said, ‘How ya doing?’ and she said ‘Good’, and then he gave her the job.
> __Luke__  I’m not even sure why she took the job I mean, I totally blew the interview.
> __Lorelai__  You were nervous.
> <span class="episode-ref">s04e10 The Nanny and the Professor</span>

Then came an epiphany along with a tangible sense of longing for the comfort of Luke’s eponymous diner. 

__What’s your favourite scene in Luke’s?__ I’m a big fan of the throwaway Luke / Lorelai pre-relationship banter and the missed signals between them that leave you screaming at the telly ‘AW COME ON!’  Like their little game of poker on the counter or any time she helps out in the store cupboard:

> __Lorelai__  Can I use the fun cutter thingy?
> __Luke__  Not if you call it the fun cutter thingy.
> <span class="episode-ref">s01e19 Emily in Wonderland</span>

My standout Luke’s moments: His bike race fury (‘Big hole!’), any time Sookie moonlights behind the counter and of course, Lorelai’s morning floor show.

**What’s your favourite Luke’s scene?**  Let’s say we’re including anything seen (or driven) through the window and I’m purposely omitting my absolute favourite.
