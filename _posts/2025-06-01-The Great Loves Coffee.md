If you had to choose, __would you pick coffee over Gilmore Girls__?  

For me Gilmore Girls is like chicken soup. It nourishes the soul and comforts and more.  I’d give up chicken soup over Gilmore Girls - if I could still have chicken.  I might even give up chicken if they’d Extra Crispy Kentucky Fry something else.

> __Lorelai__ Oh, I can’t stop drinking the coffee. I stop drinking coffee, I stop doing the standing and walking and the words putting-into-sentence doing.
> __Luke__ I’ll make you some coffee.
> <span class="episode-ref">s04e20 Luke Can See Her Face</span>

From the very first scene in the pilot episode, Lorelai’s coffee habit is as ever-present as her mother’s disappointment:

> __Lorelai__ Please, Luke. Please, please, please.
> __Luke__ How many cups have you had this morning?
> __Lorelai__ None.
> __Luke__ Plus?
> __Lorelai__ Five but yours is better.
> __Luke__ You have a problem.
> __Lorelai__ Yes I do.
> __Luke__ [filling her mug] Junkie.
> __Lorelai__ Angel. You’ve got wings, baby.
> <span class="episode-ref">s01e01 Pilot</span>

And is that her own mug she’s brought to the coffee shop?  Make of that what you will, but this woman loves coffee.  

For heaven’s sake, she dreams about coffee alongside being in love and pregnant with twins (s03e01 Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days) and she’s passed her addiction onto her daughter.  When Rory visits a psychologist after a boat-related misdemeanour, her emotional breakdown comes when thinking about her boyfriend – and that pesky bean.

> __Rory__ I... I don’t think I can take running into him every day in the halls and the paper and the coffee cart. Oh my God. I’m gonna have to quit drinking coffee – and I love coffee! [Sobbing and burying her face in a fistful of tissues]  I really love coffee.

Part of Gilmore folklore is that Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore) was not keen on coffee and drank cola instead.

The coffee-focussed folks at [Sprudge](https://sprudge.com/its-a-funny-desperate-cry-for-caffeine-coffee-and-gilmore-girls-34113.html) wryly note that:

> Lorelai takes Luke’s coffee black while she adds cream to her work coffee and her refrigerated, pre-ground home coffee: a sure sign they are destined to break up and get back together weekly for the rest of their lives.

I have a little stove-top Bialetti percolator and I savour the ritual of it, screwing the thing together, waiting for the gurgling, the aroma filling the kitchen.  But __I’d have Gilmore Girls over coffee and most food groups__, any day of the week.

Naturally it wouldn’t be a coffee article without Lorelai’s immortal words:

> __Fran at Weston’s__ Here we go. Three coffees.
> __Lorelai__ Oh, no, I’m sorry. I only ordered one.
>__Fran__ You said “Coffee, coffee, coffee”.
> __Lorelai__ Haha no see I said COFFEE-COFFEE-COFFEE.
>__Fran__ Right.
> __Lorelai__ As in I really need coffee-coffee-coffee. You know.
>__Fran__ No.
> __Lorelai__ Coffee-coffee-coffee is a saying, like an exaggeration. It’s a funny, desperate cry for caffeine. It’s just my thing. ‘Cos everybody knows I drink a lot of coffee, so the day can’t start until I’ve had my jolt. It’s a bit. My bit. It’s not a particularly funny bit unless you know me, then... You know what, three coffees would be great. What do I owe you?

Sometimes there’s nothing better than a slice of cheesecake and a cup of joe.  
__Anyone out there love coffee as much as Lorelai?__
