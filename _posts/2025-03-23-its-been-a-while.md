Right now I'm at the end of season three.  My sweet spot.  Jess is visiting his dad in Santa Monica.  Lorelai's reading Rory's yearbook and discovered that Rory is valedictorian but didn't tell her.  She's so proud you can see her eyes start to prickle but she doesn't make a scene because Rory's so busy revising and doesn't have time.  I on the other hand, am a heaving, blubbering mess. 

Wait though, let's back up a moment.

> <strong class="inline-strong">Hello.  I'm Rich and I am a Gilmore Girls fan.</strong>

There's a braindump of information about me and my history in the [About](/about.html) page.  

In short, I'm making a home for these old thoughts and scribbles.  Some have aged better than others.  Luckily, I wield complete editorial control.  

It's been a month since I put up the [holding page](/snow.html) billboard and I've been slowly chipping away.  Designing and redesigning, coding and recoding.  I'm using jekyll hosted on github, learning as I go.  Having to decide every curve, corner and colour.  The limitations and control lend themselves to finding satisfying creative solutions almost as often as blundering into yet another butt-clenching mistake.  It's not the obvious or easy way but I'm rolling around in the process like a happily curious pig in mud.  

> <strong class="inline-strong">I know how I want the blog to feel, more than how I want it to work.  That's my guiding star.</strong>

Upcoming steps are to revive, re-jig and re-post some of the old texts, in roughly chronological order.  Tastefully nipping here and tucking there.  Also hoping to fire up an RSS feed, organise categories and create category pages.  And having a hack at adding comments or some kind of feedback buttons.  

Until then it'll be a kind of sporadically updated archive with periodic twaddle, like this.

Stay tuned.
