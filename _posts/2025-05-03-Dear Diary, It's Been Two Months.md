Oh, hi again.  Question for you:  **What makes anyone do anything?**  

I mean after you've done the absolute minimum for life.  You've checked off most of  [Maslow's bottom layer](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html), how do you decide what to do next?  

Some things it never seems like the right time to do. Like starting a family or organising a massive party or writing a will.

Or you hold things at a distance so you don't have to think about them right now.  You know, like "I'll start jogging when the weather warms up."  "I'll settle down when I'm in my thirties."  "I'll send it closer to the deadline."

All ultimately arbitrary.

I think the answer is simply this: **You'll do something if you want it enough.**

You know the feeling.  When something takes priority over everything else, for whatever reason, so you just do it.  Every day we're doing it over and over.

Riding this train of thought leads to a happy place regarding procrastination. If you feel you should be doing something but feeling guilty about it... You just don't want it enough.  That's fine!  Admit it, accept it, move on.  Do something you wanna do.  Life's too short.

There's no one route to happiness but maybe learn to get along with it.

Which is a long-winded way of saying I haven't started looking at adding Comments yet. And posting infrequently but not beating myself up about it.  Been working on editing my second storybook into shape for a soft launch in June and otherwise watching life sail by.

__Wishing you peace y'all.__
