Gilmore Girls had a lot going for it.  

It had the script and the cast; the nuttiness and the budget.  The latter two led to some awesome setpieces – those big events that took planning and effort to pull off the way they did.  They made it look so effortless that we should dish out some recognition.

Remember such examples as:

    Lane’s cheerleading routine
    Rory and Logan’s big jump
    The bike race outside Luke’s
    The Festival of Living Art
    The haybale maze
    Christopher and Luke’s fight in the town square
    The world's biggest pizza

There was Kirk’s black and white movie, ‘a film by kirk‘, screened as a pre-movie treat before Lorelai’s choice for the Movie In The Square night.

> __Kirk__  I’ve made a short film that I’ve been working on for about five years now and if I rush, I can have done by Thursday night.

And who could forget his interpretive and thoroughly disturbing dance, 'The Journey Of Man' (pictured above).  It gave me nightmares for a week.

My favourite: Kirk rendition of ‘Do You Love Me?’ as Tevye in the school production of Fiddler On The Roof, opposite an amazing little Tess Helipern as his taciturn wife, Golde. I’m a sucker for musicals.
