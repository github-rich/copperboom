This blog is brought to you by the letters L and G and by the number 1, presenting irrefutable evidence that Lauren Graham has finally hit the big time.  She’s the one on the left.

Perhaps more prestigious than having a Hollywood star, winning gold at the Olympics and scaling Mount Everest all combined, LG joins the hallowed halls of those appearing on Sesame Street.

In her bit, she shares her love of writing, and stories with the adorable, irrepressible, incomparable Grover.  Watch and Learn:

[Entertainment Weekly](http://family-room.ew.com/2014/03/11/sesame-street-lauren-graham-video/) shares some behind-the-scenes action:

**Are you a fan of the Muppets?**  

**Which Gilmore person/Muppet combo would you like to see face-off?**  
**Richard Gilmore and Miss Piggy?**  
**Jess and Kermit?**  
**Taylor Doose and Fozzie Bear?**  


*(I didn’t think I’d make it to the end of this bit without mentioning that the Muppets haven’t really been the Muppets since May 1990 but I did it!  Dammit... missing you always, [Jim](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jim_Henson).)*
