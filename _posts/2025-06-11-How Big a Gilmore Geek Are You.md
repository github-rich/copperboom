__I own a Stars Hollow t-shirt__ and once wore it in a Facebook profile pic.  This was before I’d come out of the Gilmore closet and a friend of a friend – what we used to call a complete stranger – spotted it and outted me.  At first I was bashful but the floodgates were opened. All the pent-up geek came out. We started chatting on my friend’s wall about Stars Hollow and meeting up in Luke’s for coffee while our mutual friend scratched his head.

In my book, __a geek is anyone who cares for something a bit more than they think they ought to__.  It might be a TV show, it might be Marmite.  It could be Mycenaen tombs or snowy owls, wine or dubstep, nose flutes or the works of Matt Damon.  It’s not sport.  Whatever it is, it’s about __being passionate__.

__So here’s a confession__.  I have recorded every single episode of Gilmore Girls on my Digital Video Recorder (DVR).  That’s not so bad, I hear you cry.  I’m on my third re-watching – that’s watching all seven seasons once, then three times more.  So far so normal, I hear you say.  My DVR remote control uses the four coloured buttons to skip ahead a different number of seconds and I’ve set the green one to skip the exact length of the opening credits.  It's fine if you want to back slowly away.

Gilmore Girls finished its original run six years ago in May 2007 but has shown, like the girls themselves, to have terrific legs.  Through international syndication, re-runs and an astonishing level of re-watchability, the series continues to pick up fans and turn everyday people into fully fledged Gilmore Geeks.  Like me.

I read (and loved) both the books Rory and Jess recommended to each other – *The Fountainhead* and a Hemingway – *The Old Man and the Sea*.  The latter provoked a thought that Logan seemed to spend more time sleeping than reading... which would presumably have damaged his relationship with Rory the bookworm.  I've also tried a few times but never managed to complete a Proust.

I’ve shown you mine.  

__Do you stand up in the cinema and point at the screen when a Gilmore Girls actor shows up?__  
__Do you own Stars Hollow merchandise?__  
__Do you write GG fan fiction, or ever think to yourself WWLGD?__  

__Just how big a Gilmore Geek are you?__
