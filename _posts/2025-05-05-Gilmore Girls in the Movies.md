When was the last time your started lollygagging at the TV, pointing and gibbering at the screen because one of the __Gilmore Girls alumni__ turned up where they shouldn’t? What, just me? Come on, ‘fess up.

Sean Gunn (GG’s Kirk) turning up in *Glee* was a nice surprise, although he was criminally underused. And I always have a moment of re-acclimatisation seeing Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore) as the mother in *Dirty Dancing*. Uh, not that I watch *Dirty Dancing* once a year or anything.

They’ve had a fair run at the movies too, stand-outs being Milo Ventimiglia (Jess) in *Rocky Balboa* and Melissa McCarthy (Sookie) in *Bridesmaids*. Keiko Agena (Lane) recently won Best Supporting Actress for the short *Lil Tokyo Reporter* at the [AoF Awards](http://www.ltreporter.com/).

Prior to her blossoming career in publishing, Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) had a few good features under her belt. She was a Lorelai-a-like in the charming comedy *The Answer Man* (aka *Arlen Faber*) pictured above.  She had a small vocal part in the great *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*, was woefully underused in *Evan Almighty* and played memorably against type in *Bad Santa*.

Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore) carried on her Rory story in *Post Grad*, vacationed with her buddies in the enjoyable *Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants* and made the most of her baby blues in *Sin City*.
