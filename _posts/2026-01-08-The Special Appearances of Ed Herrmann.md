With profound sadness we report that Edward Herrmann, the actor who so memorably portrayed Richard Gilmore, passed away on the morning of New Year’s Eve 2014 in a hospital in New York, aged 71.

> __Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore)__ My friend Ed Herrmann was the kindest, classiest, most talented man. It was an honor and a joy to know him, a devastating blow to lose him.

Edward had been battling brain cancer and in intensive care for the last three weeks, TMZ reports. His condition did not improve and he was taken off the respirator yesterday.
 
As Richard Gilmore, his fictional, fluctuating health led to some of the most poinient moments in the show. Remember putting your hands over your mouth when he’s giving a lecture and suddenly keels over sideways? Or Lorelai standing at the foot of his post-angina attack hospital bed unable to tell him... well, unable to speak. Which is kind of how I feel right now.

> __Amy Sherman-Palladino (creator of Gilmore Girls)__ Ed Herrmann was a towering presence who filled the room with grace, laughter, Chekhov references and several salty stories. He was our patriarch… Gilmore Girls would not exist without Ed. There really are no words.

After recent appearances in *Black Box*, *The Good Wife* and *The Town That Dreaded Sundown*, his final feature will be in *Coach of the Year*, currently in post-production and slated for release in 2015.

> __David Sutcliffe (Christopher Hayden)__ Sad to hear about the passing of Ed Herrmann, aka Richard Gilmore from Gilmore Girls. Great man, great actor. He will be missed.

Edward Herrmann is survived by his wife Star Hayner and two daughters, Emma and Ryan. Also his stepson, the chef Rory Herrmann.

His on-screen wife, Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore) spoke to TVLine:

> __Kelly Bishop__ We, the Gilmore Girls family, are so terribly sad and somewhat stunned. We only learned about his illness a week or so ago. I got a call from Star Monday night asking if I wanted to come to the hospital to say good-bye. I went yesterday and was able to give Ed love from Lauren, Alexis and Amy... I have so many fond memories of our time together on Gilmore Girls and since, mainly via email. I think everyone who knew or worked with Ed found him to be absolutely delightful… Everything looks a little dim, as if the lights went down.
