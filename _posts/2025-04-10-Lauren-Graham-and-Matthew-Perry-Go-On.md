Lauren Graham appeared alongside her old bud Matthew Perry this week, in Go On. For the uninitiated, __Go On__ is a sweet NBC comedy series nearing the end of its first season. The core of show revolves around Perry’s character  Ryan King, befriending a bunch of oddballs in his therapy group, after the loss of his wife. Sounds like a hard-sell however it can't help but charm with Perry's lighthearted touch and Chandler-esque timing.  Plus a great ensemble that wouldn’t look out of place in Stars Hollow.  Or at least Woodbridge.

Lauren Graham guest-starred as Amy, one of Ryan’s old college friends.  While he becomes confused about his (and their mutual friend Steven’s) feelings for her, it smartly and lovingly resolves itself and he maybe moves a step closer to moving on. If you haven’t seen Go On, give it a try, you might like it.
