Good news first: In the Gilmore world, __dating can be fun and inventive__ and you can enjoy the hell out of it. Especially if it’s snowing.

Lorelai’s official first date with Rory’s English teacher __Max Medina__ is brought on by snow.  Lorelai’s magical snow. His car chooses to break down in Stars Hollow while Rory is stranded at Richard and Emily’s, giving them a chance to get to know each other a little better, mooching around town and dicing with spicy Fiesta burgers which they take to the Black & White & Read movie night. They chat, smooch a little and he cajoles himself into the house, where unfortunately (for the grown-ups), Lane interrupts, waiting for Rory.

__First dates are fear-inducing on a number of levels.__ You’re with a stranger doing some activity contrived to keep your mind off the awkward situation or having to talk about yourselves, when really all you want to do is get more familiar and having to, y’know... talk about yourselves. Lorelai and Max had a good time because they have a little banter, they’re a good match and it’s all the more charming because it was unexpected and natural. But Lorelai’s realistic about it:

> __Rory__ Do you love him?
> __Lorelai__ I uh... we had one date. It was a great date - World Series level - but it was just a date.
> <span class="episode-ref">s01e08 Love and War and Snow</span>

__Shared Interests are Best Shared Together__

Lorelai’s first date with __Jason ‘Digger’ Stiles__ is a good demonstration of the importance of finding the right activity. Do something you’re both comfortable with. A private room at a posh restaurant sounds nice, but isn’t fun enough for her tastes; the Taco Barn drive-thru is too exotic for him. __Find common ground__ and if you’re confident enough, pare it right back, say, to plastic furniture outside a grocery store with a small can of Pringles and Sno Balls (ah, Sno Balls, you’ll be missed). The more quirky the activity, the better the stories you’ll be able to tell the grandkids (hey, I’m an optimist).

Likewise, Alex (season 3's short-lived business seminar-attending fishing boyfriend played by Billy Burke) identifies a __common interest__, inviting her along for a coffee tasting recce. Less stressful than a formal dinner and very conducive for chatting, between sharing opinions on the brews, they’re people watching, getting a caffeine buzz and in all probability, mercilessly mocking the other clientele. Fishing as a second date though, not so hot.

If you’re courageous, __make it personal__. Take your date somewhere that means something special to you. Say, Sniffy’s Tavern with Luke and his wallet full of horoscope. As a couple, Luke and Lorelai had been building for a while before their official first date, so he was able to expose his sensitive side straight away:

> __[Luke tells the story of the first time they met, when Lorelai wrote over his horoscope and told him to hold onto it, to keep it in his wallet. That it would bring him luck]__
> __Lorelai__ Uhm I can’t believe you kept this.. You kept this in your wallet? You kept this in your wallet.
> __Luke__ Eight years.
> __Lorelai__ Eight years.
> __Luke__ Lorelai. This thing we’re doing here, me – you. I just want you to know I’m in. I am all in. Does that uh – are you… scared?  
> __[Lorelai shies away, then glances up at him, smiling. She doesn’t look scared]__

There’s some anti-April sentiment (Luke’s daughter he never knew he had, not the month) on the discussion boards, which I think is largely a reaction to this moment. When things between Luke and Lorelai become muddy and Luke becomes confused about his paternal priorities, he effectively takes back the touching moment at Sniffy’s. But of course it’s not April’s fault.

__Rory__ has her fair share of first dates too, especially after she starts college. Again, it’s not all good:

> __Rory__ I feel like I was locked into a pointless societal ritual. There has to be another way.
> __Lorelai__ Luke and I were debating that. Luke thinks it’s all about gut instinct. You know instantly if a person’s right for you. I think you have to go through a lot to find a contender. You’ve been very lucky with boys before, they were just sort of there. But, I think for the most part a girl’s gotta hunt a little.
> __Rory__ And go through a lot of non-contenders.
> __Lorelai__ Yes but then your non-contenders become your fun bad date anecdotes.

Which leads us on to... __Bad Dates in the Gilmore Girls (A Necessary Evil)__

Halfway through a disastrous first date at Yale, Rory calls home for advice while Clark-Kent-a-like Trevor is in the bathroom. Luke’s there too, Lorelai’s captive Casablanca guinea pig:

> __Rory__ I’ve already forgotten everything he said to me, the name of his brother and sister and best friend and we’re sitting on the same side of the table, we keep bumping menus and my neck already hurts from trying to turn and look at him when he talks. Can I tell him to sit on the other side?
> __Lorelai__ Honey, you just have to relax. ‘Cos it’s just a date and sometimes dates don’t go well.
> __Luke__ Dating’s the worst.
> __Lorelai__ Don’t worry about the conversation. Just talk and if the talk doesn’t flow, it doesn’t. And stay away from urine-related topics.

And Lorelai has the experience to know that even bad dates can have good sides. And she should know...

On Sookie and Jackson's first date, Lorelai helps out by double-dating __Jackson’s flat-cap-toting cousin, Rune__ – an unintentionally funny little man, disgusted by Lorelai’s height and 'size 9 feet'. They leave the stuffy French restaurant in favour of Luke’s where Jackson and Sookie can finally relax - and get rid of Rune ('Bye Loon!').   They can then talk properly, leaving Lorelai and Luke to play a little poker over the counter where Luke first raises the suggestion of Lorelai going out sometime.

> __Lorelai__ God that’s nice. The whole first date beginning of the relationship glow, everything’s new and exciting.
> __Luke__ Every joke is hilarious.
> __Lorelai__ Every little touch is incredible. That is a good feeling.
> __Luke__ It is at that.

On the other side of Stars Hollow, Rory and Dean are double-dating with Lane Kim and airhead Todd, which comes to a head when ultra-strict Mrs Kim discovers them. The confession by Rory about how she lied to Lorelai to prevent Lorelai having to lie to Mrs Kim throws out one of my favourite lines:

> __Lorelai__ I have to know where you are at all times especially when you have my shoes on.

Some final pearls from Luke and Lorelai:

> __Luke__ I mean dating - it’s a horror.
> __Lorelai__ It’s the only cure for the singleness thing barring ordering a spouse off the internet.  But dating is how you get to know your potential partner. It’s the only way.
> __Luke__ There’s the gut. I can tell if I’m comfortable with someone within seconds of meeting them.

__Which camp are you in, Luke or Lorelai’s? Ever had Luke’s gut feeling? Or is dating the only way?__
