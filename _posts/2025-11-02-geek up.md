There’s an episode in season 5 where Rory’s working in the Stars Hollow bookshop and Lane brings over a burger from Luke’s.  It’s terrible.  

While the two best friends discuss Luke’s appalling mood and the resultant burger, a man in a dark blue jacket and a woman in a white coat can be seen through the shop window.  The woman leans down and picks up a periodical from a magazine rack.

As Lane and Rory talk about just how bad the burger is, the same couple approach the rack from out-of-shot *four separate times*.  The woman leans over and picks up a periodical from the rack for three of those. It’s a bit Twilight Zone, a bit glitch-in-the-Matrix.  Look it up yourself, it’s from s05e16 So... Good Talk with a warning that once you've seen it you can't un-see it.

__Does anyone else take notice or care about this stuff?  Does it detract from the show or just distract?__  

I thought I'd come across a series-spanning continuity gaffe around Lorelai’s re-decoration of Luke’s in season 1.  When the camera whizzes around it reveals some empty shelves in a spot where TJ helpfully (!) puts up his shelves in season 6.  Did the production simply use the same shelves?  For your appreciation, witness TJ’s masterpiece of engineering from <span class="episode-ref">s06e02 Fight Face</span>:

... and the original cameo-ing behind a stepladder from <span class="episode-ref">s01e15 Christopher Returns</span>:

But there was no TV trickery involved.  TJ actually did put up different shelves, bless his heart.  Although the five years between shelf-work accumulated some seriously shadowy dinginess after Lorelai's bright and spiffy paint job...
