**Comments are now live, by jove!**  They do require a Github account which I realise is quite the barrier to entry.  However an account is free, secure and will help to keep the riff-raff out.  If you have any problems, [drop me a mail](mailto:rich@gilmoregirlsblog.com).

For your reference Github was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as a solution for software versioning.  He's the same guy who created Linux.  Today, Github is trusted by the IT industry and you can confound your computer geek friends by telling them you have a Github account because of Gilmore Girls.  

The very first time you log in, you will need to click the green button to 'Authorize utterances'.  This will let the Utterances app post to the blog.

We have also crossed the threshold of posts that fit comfortably on a single page.  Behold an **'Older Posts'** option to advance to a second page of blog posts.  Onward and upward!

In other news I finished a first draft of my second story book. Here are the first ones, fresh off the press.  I shall be handing these out this very evening to some people who inspired me.

It's the oddest feeling releasing so many words into the wild for the first time.  Like putting your kid on a train for the first time or sending them off to college.  At the moment you release it from your fingers, it has its own life and doesn't just belong to you.  

When I handed over the first printed version of my first story, I remember the recipient taking hold of it and for a few seconds my fingers wouldn't open. 

I'm happy with how this one feels.  Most of it was written during November 2023 and the rest manhandled into shape over the last month.  It's been a hard slog but I'm glad it's done.  Every word is human-generated although I did use a thesaurus from time-to-time.

**Now, what's next?**
