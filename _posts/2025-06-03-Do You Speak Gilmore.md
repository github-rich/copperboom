I was thinking there should be __a secret Gilmore Girls handshake__ or something.  Something Gilmore Geeks could share in public like a knowing wink to signal kindred spirits.  Then it hit me.  The answer was so obvious, __I was already doing it – and maybe you are too__.

If you’re anything like me (heaven forbid) at some point you’ve said to yourself ‘this is just like in Gilmore Girls when...’ or ‘that is so Kirk’ or ‘my God you’re just like Emily’.  Then sometimes you say it out loud and sometimes, some of __those wonderful wonderful words__ just come out.

For example, I was in a friend’s house and picked up a kitchen knife and said “it would do a foot”.  I swear if someone had picked up the reference I’d have had triplets.

> __Lorelai__ [Pulling a big knife out of Luke's duffel bag] Oh – my God.
> __Luke__ It’s a bowie knife to cut fish, cut tree limbs…
> __Lorelai__ Amputate a leg?
> __Luke__ Not a leg. It could do a foot.
> <span class="episode-ref">s06e15 A Vineyard Valentine</span>

Later on, when Lorelai finds Rory preparing food in the kitchen…

> __Lorelai__ Hmm. What’s this?
> __Rory__ It’s a garlic press.
> __Lorelai__ [Picks up a kitchen knife] This would do a foot.
> __Rory__ Step away from the knife.

I was in an airport when somebody called out “Marco” and I couldn’t not answer “Polo”.  I have the same knee-jerk reaction with “Toolbox” and “Dirty”.

> __Luke__ By the way, you do tell people that you’re the one that named my toolbox, right?
> __Lorelai__ Toolbox, dirty.

I’ve said __'don’t add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list'__ *(s04e20 Luke Can See Her Face)*.  I’ve called people 'Ace' in the same affectionate / patronising way Logan addresses Rory *(s05e06, Norman Mailer, I’m Pregnant)*.  I once used the word 'Whiffenpoofs' in context *(s04e09 Ted Koppel’s Big Night Out)*.

Please, I want to know it’s not just me.  

__Has anything from the show entered your vernacular?__  
__Are their voices in your head; are their words in your blood?__  
In short: __Do you speak Gilmore?__  
Even better, __have you ever picked up a reference__ dropped by someone else?
