Wouldn’t meeting Homer Simpson in real life be weird?  With his giant three-fingered hands, googly eyes and penchant for attracting mayhem, he’d be fun to watch but you might not invite him round for Thanksgiving if you wanted your house to stay standing.  But what about Lorelai Gilmore?  Would she work in real life?

On the one hand, Lorelai is a tasmanian devil.  She can be awfully grown up and in control; but equally as childish and petulant.  Witness her wrath dragging underage Madeline and Louise from a college-age party or dressing down one of Rory’s boyfriends (take your pick).  But the very same lady has no trouble expressing her inner child:

> __Lorelai__  I want a Barbie and a pony and roller skates, and roller skates for the Barbie and for the pony.
> <span class="episode-ref">s06e09 The Prodigal Daughter Returns</span>

> __Emily (reluctantly borrowing a pair of Lorelai’s shoes)__  Alright, but I won’t wear anything with rhinestones or zebra stripes or anything that has batteries or that sings or make animal noises or moves on its own.
> <span class="episode-ref">s01e19 Emily in Wonderland</span>

Lorelai expresses all three ego states, often simultaneously – a child, adult and parent – both the fun side and the serious.  In response to Emily and Richard bringing her back marzipan bunnies from cloistered Swiss nuns:

> __Lorelai__  You got me bunnies?
> __Emily__  They’re for whomever now.
> __Lorelai__  Well, no, I’ll try a bunny.
> __Emily__  Don’t force yourself.
> __Lorelai__  I’m not. I want a bunny. Give me a bunny.
> <span class="episode-ref">s04e10 The Nanny and the Professor</span>

"Whomever".  Ah, Emily.

Lorelai can defuse an explosive situation at ten paces with pure wit:

> __Lorelai__  I have to know where you are at all times, especially when you have my shoes on.
> <span class="episode-ref">s01e12 Double Date</span>

However, she’s opinionated and sometimes a snob...

> __Lorelai__  What is it about cucumber water that makes it so much more refreshing than non-cucumber water?
> <span class="episode-ref">s06e15 A Vineyard Valentine</span>

... but also a slob:

> __Rory__  Were you brushing dirt under the sink?
> __Lorelai__  No, I am brushing crumbs under the sink.
> <span class="episode-ref">s04e10 The Nanny and the Professor</span>

(She was totally brushing whole pizza crusts under the sink).

Her proud independence, especially when it comes to independence is a defining feature.  As is her superhuman metabolism and coffee addiction.  She’s also pretty damn gorgeous.  And smart.  And altruistic, putting others ahead of herself when it comes to her own happiness.

> __Lorelai__  Listen, I have to walk down the aisle in a minute and be really happy for Sookie and right now I’m having a little trouble standing, so maybe it would be better if you would just go.
> <span class="episode-ref">s02e22 I Can't Get Started</span>

It might not be as outlandish as meeting Homer Simpson, but __would you really want Lorelai as a pal in real life?__  
__Would her overactive chatter give you a headache?__  
__Would her figure, in spite of her diet, make you want to poke her eyes out?__  
__Or would she exceed your every expectation?__
