It is often said that those in entertainment should never work with children or animals.  Either the writers and producers of Gilmore Girls were gluttons for punishment or they enjoyed the challenge because there were plenty of ‘em.  

Did you love or were you kinda meh for the fortune-telling Doggy Swami AKA Paul Anka?  How about the swans that heralded Kirk’s grand entrance – back when we knew him only as ‘Swan Guy’?  Ooh, there was that big cat that wouldn’t move off the step from the cat-themed bed and breakfast too, remember?  Does the feral, young Gigi count?

Perhaps Case Study number 12 AKA Stella:

> __Sookie__  Well when you call someone and say ‘can you come over and help me look for my loose chick’ it’s a little...
> __Lorelai__  A little what?
> __Sookie__  It sounds a little like the code for ‘I’m not wearing any underwear’.

My personal favourite: Cyrus.

> __Jason__  I taught him very special commands that only my dog could know.
> __Lorelai__  Like what?
> __Jason__  Uh, like... A little to the left.
> __Lorelai__  Shut up.
...
> __Lorelai__  Can he move a little to the right?
Jason: No, not yet. We just do a little to the left until he hits the wall, and then I turn him around.
> __Lorelai__  You and your dog are extremely weird.

There was Babette’s cat Cinnamon in a bassinet?  How about the girls’ one-time hamster Skippy, who laughed at Lorelai and ended up being returned in house stuffed full of Kleenex?  Or Buttercup the rescue dog?

__Rory (reading from label)__  Buttercup is a special dog. She’s extremely skittish and tends to react badly towards blonde haired females, brunette males, children of either sex, other animals, red clothing, cabbage or anyone in a uniform.
> __Lorelai (to Luke)__  Hey, we just found the doggy version of you.

__Favourites?__  
__Waste of times?__  
Ooh there were those two horses at the Dragonfly Inn too.  __House points to anyone who can name more__
