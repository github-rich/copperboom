Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore), America Ferreira and Blake Lively threw a surprise bachelorette party earlier this week for their fourth Sister of the Traveling Pants, Amber Tamblyn.

As reported by [Wonderwall](http://wonderwall.msn.com/movies/blake-lively-ambushed-sisterhood-co-star-for-bachelorette-party-1778067.story), the aptly-named Lively lured the soon-to-be-wed Tamblyn into a cab, blindfolded her and took her to the airport.

In Tamblyn’s words:

>  I felt all of these hands pulling me out of the car. I’m like, ‘OK, I’m going to be beheaded.’ ... and it was America and Alexis. They had all surprised me and put this whole trip together to New Orleans.

Blake Lively also threw a surprise party when America Ferreira got married, whereas she herself held a secret wedding ceremony.  With three Sisters wed, there’s only one left... so no pressure, Alexis.

It’s been 9 years since the first movie and the bond between these gals seems as strong as ever.  

__Wouldn’t you love friends like these?__  
__Did you enjoy The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants, the books, the sequel?__  
__Whose bachelorette party would be more fun – Lorelai’s or Rory’s?__  
And the elephant in the room... __how long until Alexis ties the knot?__
