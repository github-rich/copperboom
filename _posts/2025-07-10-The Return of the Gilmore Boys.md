There’s a veritable Gilmore Girls pickle-fest coming up in the new series of *Chosen*.  Milo Ventimiglia (Gilmore Girls’ Jess Mariano) stars as a lawyer tasked with becoming an assassin to protect his family.  In season two, he’ll meet Chad Michael Murray (Gilmore’s Tristan DuGrey), a bartender who finds himself in the same predicament.  There's a picture of them squabbling over a pistol.

As if they weren’t enough Gilmore candy, Brandon Routh (the naughty frat boy who lures schoolgirls away from Bangles concerts and one-time Superman) is also set to appear in series two.

If memory serves, Jess and Tristan never crossed paths, though they shared Dean as a nemesis.  Most of the young guys did pretty well out of Gilmore Girls, didn’t they?  Milo memorably went super in *Heroes*, Chad squeezed every last ounce of angst from *One Tree Hill*, Jared’s still fighting monsters in *Supernatural*, Adam Brody went to *The O.C.* and Matt Czuchry is still taking names in *The Good Wife*...

I would have liked to have seen Jess and Tristan face off.  Of all of Rory’s other beaus, I think Tristan could have acquitted himself well against Jess – they were both bad boys.  But would Tristan really have had a chance with Rory? Maybe in a different world, if he hadn’t been all Tristan-y.

__Who was your favourite Gilmore Boy__, be it main cast or teeny tiny cameo?  
__Pick three:__ one to kiss, one to marry and one to push off a cliff.  My three? Richard (a man of experience), Digger (makes me laugh) and Dean (I’ll build my own car thangyouverymuch).
