Imagine Lorelai speed-dating. That’s the setup where a room full of strangers take turns to talk with each other for a few minutes until you find someone you get along with.  Not to be confused with speedballing.  Wow, imagine Lorelai speedballing. That’d be dark.

Anyhow, Lorelai Tries Speed Dating. Here’s my take.

> __[New guy sits down at Lorelai's table]__
> __Lorelai__  Hi new guy.
> __New Guy__  Well hello pretty lady.
> __Lorelai__  Next!
> __New Guy__  Wha?
> __Lorelai__  What, you’re hard of hearing too?  Next!
> __New Guy 2__  You were pretty hard on that guy.
> __Lorelai__  Life’s short. What can I say?
> __New Guy 2__  So what do you like to do?
> __New Guy 2__  Ugh, boring.
> __New Guy 2__  I’m sorry?
> __Lorelai__  You should be. We could be here all day with me saying I love musicals and donuts and you pretending to agree. You know what would be quicker? Tell me what you hate. What you secretly hate but don’t even admit to your friends?  Misery loves company.
> __New Guy 2__  I don’t like going to the cinema with people.
> __Lorelai__  What? You freak.
> __New Guy 2__  I think it’s stupid. You sit there in the dark and can’t talk to the people sitting with you.
> __Lorelai__  That’s not how I go to the cinema but thank you for your honesty. Next! ... Hi, Kirk.
> __Kirk__  Hi, I’m Kirk.  I love musicals and donuts.

That’s a roundabout introduction to this week’s moment of thoughtfulness: 

**What do you hate about Gilmore Girls?**  

**Do you find the portrayal of this fabulous parent/daughter relationship recklessly unrealistic?**
**That there's rarely a happy ending?**
**Jess’ disappearance?**
**Rory’s braid in the picture up top?**
**When Luke became Lorelai’s doormat / martyr?**
**That they ate so much but always looked amazing?**
**Was there someone spectacularly mis-cast?**
**Did you never see the point of Michel or TJ, the town troubadour or Jason ‘Digger’ Stiles?**

I was going to ban any easy targets like ‘the last season’ or ‘the movie’ or April but if you hate it, vent it.

Me?  Logan.  

There’s something about his behaviour around Marty that really gets my goat and that air of elitism between him and his buddies.  The thing is - I love how he is with people.  He can be a great guy, like with Luke and the Valentine’s Day necklace.  I totally credit Matt Czuchry for anything likeable in Logan.  I kinda want to be Logan but I don’t like who he is.  So, time to see a shrink.
