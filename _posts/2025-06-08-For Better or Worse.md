In the Gilmore universe, weddings are a time for joyous celebration, expressing soppy feelings and __destroying at least one other relationship__ to keep the karmic balance.

As you know, there’s a real life Gilmore Girls wedding waiting in the wings *[2025 Repost note: Alexis Bledel was due to marry Vincent Kartheiser]*, where I envision Kirk DJ-ing and TJ wearing tights.  But __what lessons might be learned from weddings past?__   

For better or worse, __timing is everything__.  Let’s kick off with Sookie and Jackson’s wedding:

> __Jackson__ You won’t let me wear shorts in public and you’re gonna let me get married in this?
> __Christopher__ This is absolutely unbelievable. I’ve waited years for this, Lor. You, Rory, the whole perfect picture and now…
> __Lorelai__ Listen, I have to walk down the aisle in a minute and be really happy for Sookie and right now I’m having a little trouble standing so maybe it would be better if you would just go.

This episode was a great end to the second season, bringing us ‘Oy with the poodles already’, Rory’s Bambi face, Paris and Rory winning student President and Vice-President, Chris and Lorelai deciding to give it a go for about 6 hours but their timing is bad and Jess returning to Stars Hollow from car crash exile – surprising Rory and getting a kiss in return.

Then there’s Liz and TJ’s Renaissance wedding:

> __TJ__ Well I wrote something down but for all the good points about tights and there are a lot,  they don’t have pockets. So I gotta go off the cuff… I love ya.
> __Lorelai__ Aw, that wasn’t so funny.
> __Luke__ Nah that wasn’t funny at all.  You want to dance?
> __Lorelai__ Really?
(Cue Sam Phillips’ Reflecting Light)

> __Jess__ You’re ready and I’m ready for this, you can count on me now!  I know you couldn’t count on me before but you can now, you can!
> __Rory__ No!
> __Jess__ Look you know we’re supposed to be together.  I knew it the first time I saw you two years ago and you know it too.  I know you do.

... in which Dean also rescues Rory from an awful date, setting up their poorly timed encounter at the Dragonfly grand opening.  Luke, finally, asks Lorelai out and Jess tries to take Rory away, but blows it.

There’s Richard and Emily’s renewing their vows after a period of separation, where Emily’s Machiavellian machinations backfire with Lorelai.

> __Lorelai [to Emily, with menace]__  You and me, we’re done.
> <span class="episode-ref">s05e13 Wedding Bell Blues</span>

And Lane and Zach’s two weddings, where Lorelai very publicly confronts not getting married:

> __Lorelai__ But, hey, do you know what date I’m not getting married? June 3rd. Do not save the date. Do you hear me? Do whatever you want on June 3rd, because there’s nothing at all happening on that day.
> <span class="episode-ref">s06e19 I Get A Sidekick Out Of You</span>

Lastly there’s Chris and Lorelai's impromptu French wedding that we don’t see and that nobody is invited to, including Rory.  And I guess there’s the wedding we hope for, at the end, when it seems that maybe – just maybe – the planets have finally aligned. 

Like I said, __timing is everything__.

__Favourite - or least favourite - wedding moments?__  
__If Lorelai and Luke got hitched, who’d be on the receiving end of the karmic stick?__  
Most importantly, __did Jackson honour the tradition of wearing nothing under his kilt?__
