A strapping young man walks by red brick buildings and trees, gaily calling to the shocked faces of those he passes, ‘Good morning!’, ‘Beautiful day for it!’ and ‘Hello tourists, welcome to Yale!’  A wider (rear) shot reveals he’s not wearing a stitch.

A gaggle of female students part before him to let him through, except one.  She mirrors his sidestepping until he relents.

‘Please step aside,' he says.  'I’m late as it is for Professor Farnsworth, you know how he abhors tardiness.’

‘Whereas he’s quite happy to have you sit in class stark naked?’

‘The old man’s shortsighted.  And I sit at the back.’

‘I can’t believe you’re still late when you didn’t even have to get dressed.  You’re not impressing anyone by continuing on with your precious stunt, you know.’

‘I’ll have you know it took me a good two minutes to remove my pyjamas.’

‘I mean it Richard.  How would you like it if I paraded myself around the campus naked?  Actually don’t answer that.  Honestly, if we weren’t engaged I’d start to worry.  Hasn’t the novelty worn off?’

‘I don’t know Pennilyn,’ he says.  ‘I think there are still some people who haven’t tired quite yet.’  He catches the eye of a familiar brunette on a nearby bench, who arches an eyebrow.

Ahem.

Back to reality – well, Gilmore Girls reality – and forgive me if I get any of the following ‘facts’ wrong... Richard and Emily’s was a marriage made in the sixties.  He proposed at Yale University and were wed in June 1964, when Emily was 22.  Until their short estrangement in 2004/5, they appeared to be a perfect couple – or more importantly: a perfect match.  They stayed together all that time and prospered.  

As individuals, they complement each other’s similarities and differences.  They still make each other laugh.  She understands his needs and supports him, even though he doesn’t always realise or appreciate it.  At their best – and even at their worst – they are a well-oiled machine.  But crucially, I think what makes them an a perfect team is that they have hiccups and get over them and would rather have each other, than not.  By Lorelai’s standard, they’re looking pretty darn good:

__Do you think Richard and Emily a good match?  How so - or how not?__  
__Was Emily right to blow up at Richard for staying in touch with Pennilyn Lott?__  
__Was Richard justified in keeping his little lunches a secret?__
__Would a prequel work?__  
__Who would you love in a spin-off series?__  (Aren’t Taylor and Kirk kind of Laurel and Hardy?)
