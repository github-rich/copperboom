It’s a moment of care-free innocent enjoyment and Lauren, with her hair in bunches, is so cute it’s almost annoying (‘how can you be so adorably cherubic?!’ I want to shout, pinching her porcelain cheeks, tears streaming down mine). You kinda get the feeling Lauren Graham does this kind of thing for real while Peter Krause rolls his eyes; she’s effortless.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/assets/images/gg-s01e08%20snow1.PNG" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/assets/images/gg-s01e08%20snow1.PNG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Would Rory Gilmore have a Kindle?</title><link href="https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/2025/03/23/Would-Rory-Gilmore-have-a-Kindle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Would Rory Gilmore have a Kindle?" /><published>2025-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/2025/03/23/Would%20Rory%20Gilmore%20have%20a%20Kindle</id><author><name></name></author><category term="archive" /><category term="hypothetical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s that episode where she’s berating her backpack for being too miniscule for her library of books. It’s bursting at the seams. On top of her school books, she’s packed a bus book (Milay’s biography), a lunch book (Vidal’s essays), a Faulkner novel and Eudora Welty’s short stories, for whichever mood might take her.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/assets/images/gg-busbook.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/assets/images/gg-busbook.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Oh there you are, finally.</title><link href="https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/2025/03/23/its-been-a-while/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Oh there you are, finally." /><published>2025-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.gilmoregirlsblog.com/2025/03/23/its-been-a-while</id><author><name></name></author><category term="fresh" /><category term="editorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I’m at the end of season three.
