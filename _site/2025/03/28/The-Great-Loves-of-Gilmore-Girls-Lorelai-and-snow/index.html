    <p>She glides downstairs in a red long-sleeved tee and pulls the sash window open, hangs her head out and breathes in the chilly air. It’s a moment of care-free innocent enjoyment and Lauren, with her hair in bunches, is so cute it’s almost annoying (‘how can you be so adorably cherubic?!’ I want to shout, pinching her porcelain cheeks, tears streaming down mine). You kinda get the feeling Lauren Graham does this kind of thing for real while Peter Krause rolls his eyes; she’s effortless.</p>

<p>Hey wait up, there are no curtains in the living room either!  What’s the deal with that?  Back to clipping coupons, Lorelai.  So anyway, with the icy wind blowing the netting around, she finds a spot on the sofa and replays Max’s bashful answerphone message (“It’s Max. Medina. Maaax Medina”) and on the second playthrough, it wakes Rory up.  Like any sane person, Rory goes to close the window because it’s freezing and rolls her eyes when Lorelai stops her and begins her first diatribe on her love affair with snow.  Because she can smell it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lorelai</strong>  Everything’s magical when its snows, everything looks pretty. The clothes are great. Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.
<strong>Rory</strong>  Thermal underwear, wool socks. Ear flaps.
<strong>Lorelai</strong>  Do you know the best things in my life have happened when it snowed?
<strong>Rory</strong>  Why yes, I do.
<strong>Lorelai</strong>  My best birthday.
<strong>Rory</strong>  Your first kiss.
<strong>Lorelai</strong>  Your first steps, they all happened when it snowed. 
<strong>Rory</strong>  Feet. <br />
[Lorelai pulls her feet up onto the sofa and Rory covers them with the throw]
<strong>Lorelai</strong>  I feel good. Tingly.
<strong>Lorelai</strong>  That’s called frostbite.

</blockquote>

<p>And after Rory goes back to bed, Lorelai hides under the blanket and listens to Max’s message again.  Ah, new love.
I love snow too and it’s been snowing here.  It’s magical and Christmassy and jogs some of my favourite, funnest memories.  SNOWING!!!</p>

<p>Of course every relationship has its difficulties.  Later on - in season 5 - words are exchanged in anger when the weather causes cancellations at the inn and blocking in her Jeep.  It’s a one-sided conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lorelai</strong>  Me and snow, we are through. It was years of bliss y’know, we had good stuff and good times. I could show you pictures of snow angels I’ve made but I am done! Done!!
<strong>Luke</strong>  Well, let it down easy OK?
<span class="episode-ref">s05e11 Women Of Questionable Morals</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least she has Luke, who later brokers peace between Lorelai and weather… with a homemade ice rink to chill out on.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays to all our Gilmore News readers.  Keep Warm and Best Wishes for 2013!</p>
